		I propose mining prose from online sources for use in predicting stock distribution portfolios that beat current conventional wisdom. I have currently implemented <a href="http://developer.nytimes.com/docs/read/article_search_api_v2">The New York Times Articles API</a> for mining articles about relevant companies and determining the valence of opinion, positive or negative, about them.  These valences are based on a baysian classifier that has been trained on scraped user reviews of what IMDB considers <a href="http://www.imdb.com/chart/top?ref_=chtbtm_ql_2">the best</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/chart/bottom?ref_=chttp_ql_3">the worst</a> movies of all time, e.g., <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4009460/reviews?ref_=tt_ql_8">these reviews</a> for the worst movie.  If there is a sampled New York Times article on a given date (10 per year are sampled from 2005 to 2015) for a given company, and the classifier interprets it as positive, all funds are dumped from an index fund (on the Dow Jones) into that company.  If it classifies as negative, the position in the company is sold and all funds transfered into the index fund.  The assumption is the amount of money is small enough not to affect the price and liquid enough to be completed in a day.  It is a very, very dumb algorithm, this NYT-Bot.

		<p>
		<emphasis>Shockingly</emphasis>, it is really dumb, but actually pretty good and in a particular circumstance might escape certain fluction patterns.  Here are example figures for the four stocks analyzed so far (historical price csv's can be downloaded from Yahoo, e.g. <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=YHOO">downloaded here</a>), compared with the Dow Jones (10 year csv can be <a href="https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/DJIA/downloaddata">downloaded here</a>) and the "Experts" (no csv meant their data input is scraped from Yahoo, e.g. <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ud?s=YHOO">this table</a>).  Experts are defined similarly to NYT-Bot, where anything equivalent to a "buy" on a date is for dumping the index and investing in the company, and vice versa for the "sell" equivalents.  One difference is that experts have "hold" position equivalents and those were interpreted as dumping half of one asset and investing it into the other, a hedge to the market.  Now on to the results.

		<figcaption>Fig 1. - Here we can see that NYT-Bot wasn't scared away from Apple's bullish run as much as the experts, but it did importantly diagnose that it should switch to the Dow Jones index for the latter half of 2008/early 2009 and some of that compounded to give NYT-Bot the win over the other strategies</figcaption>
