		<h1>This is my rough, but effective NLP-based Stock Market Bot</h1>

		<p>

		</p>
		<p>
		I propose mining prose from online sources for use in predicting stock distribution portfolios that beat current conventional wisdom. I have currently implemented <a href="http://developer.nytimes.com/docs/read/article_search_api_v2">The New York Times Articles API</a> for mining articles about relevant companies and determining the valence of opinion, positive or negative, about them.  These valences are based on a bayesian classifier that has been trained on scraped user reviews of what IMDB considers <a href="http://www.imdb.com/chart/top?ref_=chtbtm_ql_2">the best</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/chart/bottom?ref_=chttp_ql_3">the worst</a> movies of all time, e.g., <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4009460/reviews?ref_=tt_ql_8">these reviews</a> for the worst movie.  If there is a sampled New York Times article on a given date (10 per year are sampled from 2005 to 2015) for a given company, and the classifier interprets it as positive, all funds are dumped from an index fund (on the Dow Jones) into that company.  If it classifies as negative, the position in the company is sold and all funds transfered into the index fund.  The assumption is the amount of money is small enough not to affect the price and liquid enough to be completed in a day.  It is a very, very dumb algorithm, this NYT-Bot. 
		</p>
		<p>
		<emphasis>Shockingly</emphasis>, it is really dumb, but actually pretty good.  Here are example figures for the four stocks analyzed so far (historical price csv's can be downloaded from Yahoo, e.g. <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=YHOO">downloaded here</a>), compared with the Dow Jones (10 year csv can be <a href="https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/DJIA/downloaddata">downloaded here</a>) and the "Experts" (no csv meant their data input is scraped from Yahoo, e.g. <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ud?s=YHOO">this table</a>).  Experts are defined similarly to NYT-Bot, where anything equivalent to a "buy" on a date is for dumping the index and investing in the company, and vice versa for the "sell" equivalents.  One difference is that experts have "hold" position equivalents and those were interpreted as dumping half of one asset and investing it into the other, a hedge to the market.  Now on to the results.

		<figcaption>Fig 1. - Here we can see that NYT-Bot wasn't scared away from Apple's bullish run as much as the experts, but it did importantly diagnose that it should switch to the Dow Jones index for the latter half of 2008/early 2009 and some of that compounded to give NYT-Bot the win over the other strategies, at least for this tech juggernaut.</figcaption>

		<figcaption>Fig 2. - Another case of NYT-Bot being better than the experts.  Here it correctly figured out it should dump its Bank of America position in early 2012 and was able to recover to almost its starting money by this week.  The experts stayed sunk with the ship, rather than riding the index tide apart from the bank.</figcaption>

		<figcaption>Fig 3. - Here, NYT-Bot is showing itself to be mortal and finishing slightly below Disney and the experts, but all of them well ahead of the index.</figcaption>

		<figcaption>Fig 4. - Wal-Mart doesn't move much, so neither did the experts or NYT-Bot.  Dummy bot won in a photo-finish because of more interesting market divergence in 2013.</figcaption>

		<h3>Where to go from here?</h3>
		<p>
		Algorithmically, this is far from its most interesting final form.  The most obvious next step is to run it on a subset of the market, instead of just one company versus an index.  This would allow for far more interesting composite stances on what to invest in and how.  Approaches for this mixture model would range from the more obvious linear regression variants to the more interesting unsupervised learning approaches.  This is also just a very simple buy/sell model without anything more complicated as a financial instrument. Finally, the natural language processing should be far more interesting and complicated, rather than just a simple dictionary of decontextualized words and their bayesian associations with good or bad.
		</p>
		<p>
		Professionally, the code is nowhere near up to snuff.  Beyond needing to be structured and commented better to allow for more ease of flexibility with features, it has a for loop for updating the main consolidated data table with the emulated Expert and NYT-Bot results, and that has to go.  It's way too slow, and should probably be a list comprehension or something.  There is no meaningful user interface, either.  This is really just a hack of a script for proof-of-concept in a weekend.
